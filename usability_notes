## landing page
- change copy: "turn your texts into audio"
- if the user is logged in, they should skip the landing page

## overall layout (i think Layout.jsx?)
- should have a little banner at the top with logo that says textbook-tts or smth
- logout in top right corner

## main app page (/app)
- make the upload button bigger and more central
- add the same cloud icon to the upload button as in the upload tab on the LHS
- combine /upload and /app into a single page. should always have upload ability

## upload page (/upload)
- 1 less button press (as soon as user chooses file, the upload starts)

## view page (/app/view)
- play button should be front and center immediately
-- to do this, need streaming functionality (can do that)
-- track progress in stream (if user closes page or whatever)
- buttons to jump ahead and back
- highlight where the user is in the reading

## model / algorithm improvements
- skip obvious junk?
